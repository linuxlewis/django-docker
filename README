# About
This is the base template for a Docker and docker-compose setup for
a basic django project. It includes a database, and redis cache server


# How to use

```bash
git clone git@github.com:linuxlewis/django-docker.git
cd django-docker/
cp . ../your-project
cd ../your-project
docker-compose up -d
```

Don't forget to update your ```settings.py``` with the database information.
A default configuration can be found in ```docker-compose.yml```
